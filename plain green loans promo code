Payday loan lending has been around for years making it possible for consumers to have access to fast cash without worrying about credit worthiness or approval waiting times. Financial emergencies often times require money in a hurry and most "traditional" lenders, such as banks and credit unions, don't offer the timeliness that is equally matched to payday lenders. With these types of short-term loans, consumers are expected to pay back what they borrow within a small-time frame; usually with their next paycheck. Lenders use their own collectors to deal with defaulted payments but identity thieves have found their own way to try and collect on these loans, and unfortunately many consumers are falling for this!

Payday loan lenders, also know as providers of "small dollar loans", withdraw loan payments from the borrower's bank account on or around the same day that the borrower's paycheck goes in their bank account. In the event that the money is not available for repayment, the lender will most likely be willing to make payment arrangement's with the borrow in an effort to see them repay their loan successfully. If that doesn't work, then a collector will get involved. It will most likely be someone from the payday loan lending company, or perhaps a third-party collector. Lenders will never get the police involved nor will the seek out the FBI to regain their lost funds.
